His Death and subsequent ascention of Great Patriarch Reynauld caused a succession crisis and a bloody war ensued between core and outlying regions. Led by a Nossian Conclave, the war effort went surprisingly well, being able to drive The Gamides back from even their core worlds, though progress was slow and grinding. Several decades of warfare was thought to lead to total Nossian victory, but fierce resistance by Gamidic forces prevented their outright annihilation. These decades of war did not leave the Nossians untarnished however. Nossus, being the powerhouse of the Outlying regions, took quick total control and subsumed other systems under its banner, including the Prison Planet Salusa secundus. major prison populations and undesireables were sent into meatgrinder battles and sprung upon civilian sectors, which caused major disapproval among peer states.
