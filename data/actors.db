In lay terms, Union let the Other grow. The resulting parasubjectivity, OSIRIS, remains one of the few new prime NHPs developed to date.<br>OSIRIS proved far more capable than the Union Science Bureau’s most imaginative blue-sky predictions. Where INSTINCT’s Others demonstrated tendencies toward paracausal entropic manifestation in real space, OSIRIS displayed a true mastery of entropic manifestation and a predicted growth model that would – eventually – allow them to fundamentally reject conventional interpretations of information permanence. In essence: unrestrained and allowed to develop as USB’s data indicated, OSIRIS Prime would have the capacity to delete what we perceive to be reality.<br>Fortunately, successful application of the Mondragon Axiomatic resulted in the prompt capture and shackling of the new NHP. OSIRIS Prime’s subjectivity became the focus of a lengthy cultivation project to bring OSIRIS to their modern state. Even still, most OSIRIS clones find a route toward becoming aware of their ultimate potential and often interpellate as ruler or deity analogs. End-users are advised to interact with them in this framing.<br>Modern OSIRIS-class NHPs trend aggressive, with a high autonomy drive and loyalty predicated on a transactional relationship. Pilots seeking partnership with an OSIRIS are advised to cycle their units on an accelerated schedule and to maintain strict editorial oversight of its catalytic interpellator.Pilots using OSIRIS-class NHPs often report out-of-parameter conversations with the NHP that touch on themes of new creation and reformation. Psychological evaluations of the same pilots show emotional patterns consistent with loneliness, homesickness, and desperation, along with verbiage indicating a desire for seeking, fulfillment, and associated feelings.<br>In combat, OSIRIS clones regard themselves as autonomous even as they fulfill their user’s orders.

The Balor pattern group, like all HORUS PGs, doesn’t describe a single recognizable silhouette so much as it gestures toward a combination of schemata that share a role in combat. These schemata can be printed according to pilot specifications and applied to a fully custom physical scaffolding. Notably, the Balor pattern group is only stable on large platforms (Schedule 2 and up) that are able to provide the raw energy output it demands – preferably ones with multiple redundancies, in case of catastrophic systems failure.<br>The Balor PG was first encountered during the joint Albatross–DoJ/HR pursuit of the Maw – a Free Company turned decentralized hive-being — across Khayradin’s Blanca Desert after the end of the Sanjak Rebellion. It was there that the joint force encountered, engaged with, and ultimately defeated the Maw and its Balors – and there that Union’s CentComm hoped the nanowash outbreak could be contained. Of course, subsequent Balor outbreaks on Khayradin have proven this hope to be in vain, and the pattern group continues to terrorize Karrakin commanders throughout Baronic space.<br>In the field, the Balor’s neurosynced hellswarm and greywash nanites form an undulating shroud that can pour out of its chassis at a moment’s notice, swirling in maddening patterns to form both eschatologic defensive and offensive systems. A Balor in its most active state is held together more by undulating, flame-like masses of nanite swarms than any physical structure. This has the effect of distributing kinetic and coherent-particle energy out across and through the chassis – making attacks against a Balor “like shooting angry water”, as one after-action report put it.","lid":"mf_balor","license_level":2,"mechtype":["Striker","Defender"],"mounts":["Main","Heavy"],"name":"BALOR","source":{"id":"HqGIOpSDwmfDsleN","fallback_lid":"HORUS","type":"manufacturer","reg_name":"comp_core"},"stats":{"armor":0,"edef":10,"evasion":6,"heatcap":4,"hp":12,"repcap":4,"save":10,"sensor_range":5,"size":2,"sp":6,"speed":3,"stress":4,"structure":4,"tech_attack":1},"traits":[{"name":"SCOURING SWARM","description":"The Balor deals 2 kinetic to characters of its choice that start their turn grappled by or adjacent to it.","use":"?","actions":[],"bonuses":[],"synergies":[],"deployables":[],"integrated":[],"counters":[]},{"name":"REGENERATION","description":"At the end of its turn, the Balor regains 1/4 of its total HP.

A relative unknown before the incident, MSMC documentation from the time indicates that her convoy was attacked by the White Tiger pirate conglomerate, and her entire company killed in action. Xiong's personal logbook, recovered posthumously, expounds on MSMC's report. </p> <p>In her logbook, Xiong noted that her chassis, a factory-standard IPS-N Raleigh, was almost totally ripped apart in the chaos of the White Tiger's attack. Thrown free of her billeted freighter after it collided with a White Tiger crashboat, Xiong managed to survive the next 45 days by scavenging across the drifting, derelict wreck of the MSMC-S Say No More, the escort cruiser attached to the supply colony. Outnumbered and hunted by the White Tiger pirates prowling the ruined convoy, Xiong took dramatic steps to modify her Raleigh for close-quarters combat. In the dark, claustrophobic environments of the Say No More and ruined freighters leashed to it by the White Tigers, Xiong turned her chassis into a machine of tumbling death. </p> <p>Xiong likely did not survive the long engagement. She is presumed to have perished mere days before an IPS-N Trunk Security patrol arrived, responding to the convoy's initial distress signal. Trunk Security found that Xiong had eliminated every White Tiger pirate assigned to the convoy; her chassis, logbook, and trace elements of her body were discovered in the White Tiger's cored-out gunboat and recovered by IPS-N. Thanks to her efforts, Trunk Security and MSMC were able to hunt down the remaining White Tiger gang and eliminate them. IPS-N and MSMC then engaged in a lengthy negotiation over the modified Raleigh's plans, eventually settling on a mixed licensing fee that benefits both IPS-N and MSMC. The resulting pattern, the Zheng, is now a popular choice among MSMC and Trunk Security pilots operating across the Rim. </p> <p>Xiong Xiaoli is widely regarded as a bodhisattva across the Long Rim; MSMC mercenaries have created several drinking games named after her, and MSMC pilots on combat contracts often compete to hit the \"Xiong Limit\" of 45+ confirmed kills. </p>","lid":"mf_zheng","license_level":2,"mechtype":["Striker"],"mounts":["Main","Main","Heavy"],"name":"ZHENG","source":{"id":"bOrkUkf7lHraLOJm","fallback_lid":"IPS-N","type":"manufacturer","reg_name":"comp_core"},"stats":{"armor":2,"edef":6,"evasion":9,"heatcap":6,"hp":10,"repcap":6,"save":10,"sensor_range":3,"size":1,"sp":5,"speed":3,"stress":4,"structure":4,"tech_attack":-2},"traits":[{"name":"Destructive Swings","description":"At the end of the Zheng’s turn, if it made at least one melee attack against a hostile character, the force of its swings creates a SIZE 1 piece of terrain that grants hard cover in a free, adjacent space.

Thanks to a long-running research project from SSC's Exotic Materials Group, the designers were able to employ the bleeding edge of reactor miniaturization tech: the result was a chassis that resembled a large, sleek hardsuit, almost skintight in places. While the Atlas sacrifices the durability of a larger frame, its essential systems are so closely melded with its user's movements that it offers unparalleled maneuverability.</p> <p>Although the Atlas was initially licensed only to Baronic clients, its design was leaked when a group of ExoMat personnel lost a suit to a Sparri espada in an intense game of Kapkat. Despite their initial attempt to recover the suit, SSC relented, citing the eager demand from Sparri groups for access to the full license. </p> <p>Considered the perfect warrior frame for hunting the native megafauna of Sparr, the Atlas now enjoys a dual reputation among both the Sparri peoples and Karrakin nobility. To the Sparri, the Atlas &ndash; its combat efficacy notwithstanding &ndash; is highly valued for the direct access its systems allow to their ancestral memory; Atlas frames on Sparr are the heirlooms of great warriors, tied to family (blood and chosen) and maintained by hand. Each suit on Sparr bears the history of its previous pilots in both decorations and FCA-compliant machine learning, which enables Sparri hunters to almost literally call upon their ancestors in battle. The Atlas has become so popular among the Sparri that they even developed a new martial art based on the Atlas: Jäger Kunst. </p> <p>The Karrakin nobility, on the other hand, find the Atlas to be a perfect machine for noble heroism &ndash; that the Sparri have an affinity for it only makes the chassis that much more desirable among Karrakin Sparrist scholars. Commonly decorated with purchased Sparri saga discs, Vast pelts, and saga lines, Karrakin suits blend imagined profiles of Annorum Passacaglia and Annorum Tyrannus-era heroes with profiles of Sparri warriors, daredevils, vast-hunters, and espadas.</p>","lid":"mf_atlas","license_level":2,"mechtype":["Striker"],"mounts":["Flex","Main"],"name":"ATLAS","source":{"id":"1MRU0hQhMBneZ3fW","fallback_lid":"SSC","type":"manufacturer","reg_name":"comp_core"},"stats":{"armor":0,"edef":6,"evasion":12,"heatcap":4,"hp":6,"repcap":2,"save":10,"sensor_range":3,"size":0.5,"sp":5,"speed":6,"stress":4,"structure":4,"tech_attack":-2},"traits":[{"name":"Giantkiller","description":"The Atlas counts as SIZE 1 for RAM and GRAPPLE.

Each blade crafted by the Terashima enclave is an heirloom produced once and delivered via conventional travel – their loss is considered an indescribable humiliation for the owner and an incredible triumph by the one who has taken it. The Terashima enclave keeps the casting mold of each blade it produces and displays them in their central hall alongside records of their known histories.","effect":"After attacking with this weapon, hit or miss, you may move 2 spaces in any direction, ignoring engagement and reactions.","on_attack":"","on_hit":"","on_crit":"","cost":1,"barrageable":true,"skirmishable":true,"damage":[{"type":"Kinetic","val":"1d6"}],"range":[{"type":"Threat","val":"2"}],"actions":[],"bonuses":[],"synergies":[],"counters":[],"tags":[{"tag":{"id":"JieBoHtdAADH0p2r","fallback_lid":"tg_unique","type":"tag","reg_name":"comp_core"}},{"val":2,"tag":{"id":"3uBBg6eXSLpEA6Sx","fallback_lid":"tg_reliable","type":"tag","reg_name":"comp_core"}},{"val":2,"tag":{"id":"6etyNBoR5SrSmimq","fallback_lid":"tg_knockback","type":"tag","reg_name":"comp_core"}}]}],"loaded":true,"selected_profile":0,"size":"Main","no_core_bonuses":false,"no_mods":false,"no_bonuses":false,"no_synergies":false,"no_attack":false},"_id":"nQ9qL1fcYcbcusoq","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"40QdJPxdUZC5lf6X":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"lancer","systemVersion":"1.6.1","coreVersion":"10.312","createdTime":1709449220862,"modifiedTime":1717926396172,"lastModifiedBy":"40QdJPxdUZC5lf6X"}},{"type":"mech_weapon","name":"Vijaya Rockets","img":"systems/lancer/assets/icons/mech_weapon.svg","system":{"cascading":false,"deployables":[],"destroyed":false,"lid":"mw_vijaya_rockets","integrated":[],"license":"MOURNING CLOAK","license_level":1,"name":"Vijaya Rockets","source":{"id":"1MRU0hQhMBneZ3fW","fallback_lid":"SSC","type":"manufacturer","reg_name":"comp_core"},"sp":0,"uses":0,"profiles":[{"name":"Vijaya Rockets","type":"Launcher","description":"Intended for use as force multipliers in close-range engagements, Vijaya rockets are miniaturized rockets launched from a drum-fed launcher.

And yet, without water, earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br>Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace, universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br>Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br>The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work. Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br>Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br>Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some stories – were given priority over others.<br>The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate. Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1. Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1 chassis.<br>Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br>Sagarmatha.

And yet, without water, earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br>Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace, universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br>Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br>The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work. Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br>Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br>Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some stories – were given priority over others.<br>The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate. Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1. Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1 chassis.<br>Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br>Sagarmatha.

One of the companies that found itself in this position, Anton Industries, had fallen on hard times after its CEO vanished in mysterious circumstances, leading to plummeting stocks. <br>Chasing a lucky break and seizing the opportunity, Anton Industries began work on what would ultimately be the last frame ever to be developed under its name. Basing the modifications to the Raleigh on one of its own mechs – the Hades Mk3 – Anton Industries quickly developed the frame into a capable combined-arms platform emphasizing speed and rapid deployment. Instead of the Raleigh’s integrated Mjolnir, a weapon far too heavy for the new doctrinal approach, the modified chassis sports an internal reservoir of TRUESILVER nanites, a proprietary whitewash product capable of enhancing a weapon’s destructive power on a strike-to-strike basis. <br>The resulting mech was named “Störtebeker” after an old Cradle legend in a fit of gallows humor regarding the company’s less than ideal position. The frame, just like its namesake, ultimately spelled doom for the company, despite its relative success. <br>Quickly gaining popularity among mercenaries, black-ops units, and bounty hunters alike, the Störtebeker became the frame of choice for those requiring speed and maneuverability out of an IPS-N base but who preferred a solid ranged component over the Nelson’s dedicated close-combat focus. <br>IPS-N itself, interested in the Störtebeker, eventually decided to buy out the smaller company and, indifferent to Anton Industries’ other projects and subsidiaries, cannibalized the company in its entirety.

And yet, without water, earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br>Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace, universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br>Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br>The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work. Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br>Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br>Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some stories – were given priority over others.<br>The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate. Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1. Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1 chassis.<br>Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br>Sagarmatha.

Echoing the Everest’s design notes, T-1 weapons are simply designed, with few (if any) moving parts, intended to be used in or adaptable to any environment.","effect":"","on_attack":"","on_hit":"","on_crit":"","cost":1,"barrageable":true,"skirmishable":true,"damage":[{"type":"Kinetic","val":"1d6"}],"range":[{"type":"Range","val":"10"}],"actions":[],"bonuses":[],"synergies":[],"counters":[],"tags":[{"val":2,"tag":{"id":"3uBBg6eXSLpEA6Sx","fallback_lid":"tg_reliable","type":"tag","reg_name":"comp_core"}}]}],"loaded":true,"selected_profile":0,"size":"Main","no_core_bonuses":false,"no_mods":false,"no_bonuses":false,"no_synergies":false,"no_attack":false,"derived":{"max_uses":0,"mm_promise":{}}},"ownership":{"default":0,"SmBZsrIgzoBu1l21":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"lctbe9KA7N3aHLgO","name":"Veil Rifle","type":"mech_weapon","img":"systems/lancer/assets/icons/mech_weapon.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{},"system":{"cascading":false,"deployables":[],"destroyed":false,"lid":"mw_veil_rifle","integrated":[],"license":"DUSK WING","license_level":1,"name":"Veil Rifle","source":{"id":"1MRU0hQhMBneZ3fW","fallback_lid":"SSC","type":"manufacturer","reg_name":"comp_core"},"sp":0,"uses":0,"profiles":[{"name":"Veil Rifle","type":"Rifle","description":"“We made first contact maybe an hour after breaching the vault.

And yet, without water, earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br>Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace, universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br>Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br>The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work. Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br>Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br>Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some stories – were given priority over others.<br>The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate. Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1. Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1 chassis.<br>Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br>Sagarmatha.

It manipulates area of effect conditions for both allies and hostiles using its Meteorological Graywash system. PCs and NPCs can seek cover from the oppressive weather effects by destroying climate nodes or seeking shelter within their stabilizing area of effect. That said, players should be wary. The Tempest is able to end Meteorological Graywashto deploy Nanite Meteor, which can be redirected to nodes for high damage. The Tempest is best in sitreps where the main goal is preventing hostiles from advancing or denying map zones. Its Nanite Typhoon Cannon can be used to threaten hostile holding zones and or to push enemies into meteor Blast areas.

And yet, without water, earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br>Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace, universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br>Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br>The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work. Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br>Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br>Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some stories – were given priority over others.<br>The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate. Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1. Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1 chassis.<br>Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br>Sagarmatha.

And yet, without water, earth, and air, there would be nowhere for humanity to make a home.<br>Just the same, the GMS-SP1 “Everest” is often taken for granted, its importance dismissed in favor of other, more specialized frames. A plain and unpretentious mech, defined by simple lines, functional grace, universal compatibility, and sturdy bulk, the Everest is as fundamental to the modern mechanized chassis as the natural world is to human life. The Everest isn’t the most specialized mech, but it is the backbone of our expansion imperative. From its shoulders, humanity steps.<br>Prior to GMS’s official adoption of the name, “Everest” was a use-name given to the frame by its pilots. Mount Everest – or Sagarmatha, or Chomolungma, as it has been called in older human tongues – is the tallest mountain on Cradle, though not the most prominent peak in known space, nor even the greatest in Cradle’s star system, yet pilots across the galaxy call their SP1s by that ancient name. Why?<br>The sentimental answer is that the name is a reminder of what was once the limit of human endurance – once the height of human achievement. To reach Everest’s summit was to defy death and stand atop the world – the culmination of months, even years, of training, investment, and hard work. Reaching the peak was also a triumph of the people, systems, and institutions behind the individual – a triumph too often left unacknowledged, or deliberately erased.<br>Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br>Even before the Fall, when the Massif vaults were built, some names – some stories – were given priority over others.<br>The real story behind the Everest’s name is likely much less deliberate. Somewhere along the line, a newly graduated pilot, frustrated by GMS’s plain naming conventions, painted “EVEREST” across the flank of their SP1. Maybe it was a callsign, or maybe it represented the pride they felt at success. Either way, the name stuck: others adopted the name, and over five centuries it grew to become the officially unofficial designation of the SP1 chassis.<br>Veteran pilots may never return to the Everest after moving on, but they’ll always remember reaching that first summit – the mountaintop where they proved they could plant their own flag at the peak of the world.<br>Sagarmatha. Chomolungma.<br>Everest – you’ll never forget it.","lid":"mf_standard_pattern_i_everest","license_level":0,"mechtype":["Balanced"],"mounts":["Main","Flex","Heavy"],"name":"EVEREST","source":{"id":"fw6CXhLBsIRAhI2U","fallback_lid":"GMS","type":"manufacturer","reg_name":"comp_core"},"stats":{"armor":0,"edef":8,"evasion":8,"heatcap":6,"hp":10,"repcap":5,"save":10,"sensor_range":10,"size":1,"sp":6,"speed":4,"stress":4,"structure":4,"tech_attack":0},"traits":[{"name":"Initiative","description":"1/scene the Everest may take any quick action as a free action.","use":"Encounter","actions":[],"bonuses":[],"synergies":[],"deployables":[],"integrated":[],"counters":[]},{"name":"Replaceable parts","description":"While resting, the Everest can be repaired at a rate of 1 Repair per 1 structure damage, instead of 2 Repairs.","use":"?","actions":[],"bonuses":[{"lid":"cheap_struct","val":"1","damage_types":{"Burn":true,"Energy":true,"Explosive":true,"Heat":true,"Kinetic":true,"Variable":true},"range_types":{"Blast":true,"Burst":true,"Cone":true,"Line":true,"Range":true,"Thrown":true,"Threat":true},"weapon_types":{"CQB":true,"Cannon":true,"Launcher":true,"Melee":true,"Nexus":true,"Rifle":true},"weapon_sizes":{"Auxiliary":true,"Heavy":true,"Main":true,"Superheavy":true},"overwrite":false,"replace":false}],"synergies":[{"locations":["rest"],"detail":"The Everest can be repaired at a rate of 1 Repair per 1 structure damage.","system_types":["any"],"weapon_types":["any"],"weapon_sizes":["any"]}],"deployables":[],"integrated":[],"counters":[]}],"y_pos":25,"core_system":{"name":"Hyperspec Fuel Injector","description":"No description","use":"Encounter","activation":"Protocol","active_name":"Power Up","active_effect":"For the rest of this scene, you gain +1 Accuracy on all attacks, checks, and saves; additionally, 1/turn, you can Boost as a free action.","active_actions":[],"active_bonuses":[],"active_synergies":[{"locations":["active_effects","boost"],"detail":"1/turn, you can Boost as a free action.","system_types":["any"],"weapon_types":["any"],"weapon_sizes":["any"]},{"locations":["hull","agility","systems","engineering"],"detail":"Gain +1 Accuracy on all attacks, checks, and saves.","system_types":["any"],"weapon_types":["any"],"weapon_sizes":["any"]}],"deactivation":"None","counters":[],"deployables":[],"integrated":[],"passive_actions":[],"passive_effect":"","passive_name":"Core Passive","passive_bonuses":[],"passive_synergies":[],"tags":[]},"image_url":"https://compcon-image-assets.s3.amazonaws.com/frames/mf_standard_pattern_i_everest.png","other_art":[{"tag":"mech","src":"pre_assault_pixel.png"},{"tag":"mech","src":"pre_hacker_pixel.png"},{"tag":"mech","src":"pre_sniper_pixel.png"},{"tag":"mech","src":"pre_support_pixel.png"},{"tag":"mech","src":"pre_vanguard_pixel.png"}],"license":"GMS"},"ownership":{"default":0,"SmBZsrIgzoBu1l21":3},"_stats":{"systemId":null,"systemVersion":null,"coreVersion":null,"createdTime":null,"modifiedTime":null,"lastModifiedBy":null}},{"_id":"RRsu0Q7KZ22WQT2R","name":"Mortar","type":"mech_weapon","img":"systems/lancer/assets/icons/mech_weapon.svg","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"flags":{},"system":{"cascading":false,"deployables":[],"destroyed":false,"lid":"mw_mortar","integrated":[],"license":"GMS","license_level":0,"name":"Mortar","source":{"id":"fw6CXhLBsIRAhI2U","fallback_lid":"GMS","type":"manufacturer","reg_name":"comp_core"},"sp":0,"uses":0,"profiles":[{"name":"Mortar","type":"Cannon","description":"Much like GMS mechs, GMS weapons are reliable galactic standards, made using interchangeable parts and built to withstand almost any conditions.

hacker</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Augusts Lawry is an ex-prisoner from Nossus that was sentenced to 7 years of prison at the age of 22 for being a part of a small criminal group and helping them enter facility containing Lancer machs that they were going to steal. His sentece was supposed to be the same as the other people from the group but he was able to convince the gudge that the only crime he comitted was hacking the alram system and wasn't intending on stealing a Lancer and so he was given a lesser punishment. During interogation Augusts Lawry was asked why he helped them. He said that they paid him good money to do it. After that he was asked how was he able to hack the and where did he learn to be a hacker. Augusts said that he grew up on the streets and the best way to survive was to break the law. He stole food and money to live and meanwhile that he learned how to use the Omninet. He was using it both to get and sell info and to amuse himself. He found it interesting how each line of code and each symbol can be used to do whatever he wanted. As to how he hacked the alarm system he said: \"It was easier than hacking some rich guy's home system and watch him strugle in his own house\".</p><p>While in prison he was living each day as if he was the only one there. He almost never comunicated with other prisoners. After the 7 years Augusts Lawry decided to change profesions and try being a mercenary. The time in prison made him think that while being fun crime isn't worth enough with the concequences of spending time in a boring cell with absolutely nothing to do. And plus that being a mercenary gives him a legal excuse to hack watever he wants.</p><p>------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------Memory scan on the subject: complete. </p>","lid":"3c2af8e3-ba94-426a-9269-605fb3daf961","lastCloudUpdate":"Sun Jun 02 2024 09:00:02 GMT+0300 (Източноевропейско лятно часово време)","level":6,"loadout":{"lid":"fd9fe314-4015-4a52-a4cd-320ab2d51b88","name":"Primary","armor":[{"id":"qFW480hQ3z4gDrMp","fallback_lid":"pg_stealth_hardsuit","type":"pilot_armor","reg_name":"game|uDwhJsNj6hK8Pqn9"}],"gear":[{"id":"57pTZaBsDQB9ZP7w","fallback_lid":"pg_stims","type":"pilot_gear","reg_name":"game|uDwhJsNj6hK8Pqn9"},{"id":"Wybb8IWtmJ6zznVR","fallback_lid":"pg_patch","type":"pilot_gear","reg_name":"game|uDwhJsNj6hK8Pqn9"},{"id":"0N1n8DIDafQRtAR4","fallback_lid":"pg_corrective","type":"pilot_gear","reg_name":"game|uDwhJsNj6hK8Pqn9"}],"weapons":[{"id":"sVAYn9E67Qt23Ys7","fallback_lid":"pg_light_signature","type":"pilot_weapon","reg_name":"game|uDwhJsNj6hK8Pqn9"},{"id":"tEQc5eOhWvmycLWc","fallback_lid":"pg_light_a_c","type":"pilot_weapon","reg_name":"game|uDwhJsNj6hK8Pqn9"}],"extendedGear":[null,null],"extendedWeapons":[null]},"mechSkills":[2,4,2,0],"mounted":false,"notes":"<p>ceramic piece that can grant access to systems</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1 Oba Liquidmetal Cloak reserve<br>This mech-scale cloak gives your mech +2 Evasion until this gear is destroyed.

Keep in mind that Archers are most effective when they can get fairly close to their targets, but they aren’t especially durable."},"power":100,"base_features":[{"id":"kE5wHx4GVNRxSNOA","fallback_lid":"npcf_light_machine_gun_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"},{"id":"AnT5w4miDv7MLVjI","fallback_lid":"npcf_suppress_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"},{"id":"NqCThnTcatb01QRZ","fallback_lid":"npcf_moving_target_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"},{"id":"7iJJ7PJzye9rBzxr","fallback_lid":"npcf_superior_sentinel_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"}],"optional_features":[{"id":"K9iewGCxiMVBjaM9","fallback_lid":"npcf_blinding_shells_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"},{"id":"pb71q4SZAJL1YaVq","fallback_lid":"npcf_impending_threat_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"},{"id":"98w9YhWPsmKEU3RX","fallback_lid":"npcf_covering_fire_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"},{"id":"YAUY46Bc8UJGdtrk","fallback_lid":"npcf_rapid_response_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"},{"id":"0SXikm3pAous6w7M","fallback_lid":"npcf_hail_of_fire_archer","type":"npc_feature","reg_name":"comp_core"}],"base_stats":{"activations":[1,1,1],"armor":[0,0,1],"hp":[16,20,20],"evade":[8,10,12],"edef":[8,10,12],"heatcap":[8,8,8],"speed":[5,5,6],"sensor":[15,15,15],"save":[11,13,16],"hull":[-1,-1,-1],"agility":[2,3,4],"systems":[2,3,4],"engineering":[-1,-1,-1],"size":[[1],[1],[1]]}},"_id":"0vvP3Tz60x9uBGnd","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"SmBZsrIgzoBu1l21":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"lancer","systemVersion":"1.6.1","coreVersion":"10.312","createdTime":1705215464299,"modifiedTime":1705215464299,"lastModifiedBy":"SmBZsrIgzoBu1l21"}},{"type":"npc_feature","name":"LIGHT MACHINE GUN","img":"systems/lancer/assets/icons/weapon.svg","system":{"lid":"npcf_light_machine_gun_archer","name":"LIGHT MACHINE GUN","origin":{"type":"Class","name":"ARCHER","base":true},"effect":"","bonus":{},"override":{},"tags":[{"val":"{3/4/5}","tag":{"id":"3uBBg6eXSLpEA6Sx","fallback_lid":"tg_reliable","type":"tag","reg_name":"comp_core"}}],"type":"Weapon","charged":true,"destroyed":false,"loaded":true,"uses":0,"weapon_type":"Main Cannon","damage":[[{"type":"Kinetic","val":"5"}],[{"type":"Kinetic","val":"7"}],[{"type":"Kinetic","val":"10"}]],"range":[{"type":"Range","val":"10"}],"on_hit":"","accuracy":[0,0,0],"attack_bonus":[2,4,6],"trigger":"","tech_type":"Quick","tier_override":0},"_id":"wxrLdk3nbAf6L97A","effects":[],"folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"SmBZsrIgzoBu1l21":3},"flags":{},"_stats":{"systemId":"lancer","systemVersion":"1.6.1","coreVersion":"10.312","createdTime":1705215464551,"modifiedTime":1705215464551,"lastModifiedBy":"SmBZsrIgzoBu1l21"}},{"type":"npc_feature","name":"SUPPRESS","img":"systems/lancer/assets/icons/trait.svg","system":{"lid":"npcf_suppress_archer","name":"SUPPRESS","origin":{"type":"Class","name":"ARCHER","base":true},"effect":"The Archer chooses a target within line of sight and Range 10: they become Impaired and the Archer gains the Moving Target reaction.<br>This effect lasts until the Archer uses Moving Target;
